    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        There are many Korean dishes that are fairly well known, especially as Korean food has 
        become more mainstream. These include kalbi, bulgogi, korean chicken wings, etc. Oh, 
        and kimchi of course! However, one of my favorite <em>favorite</em> dishes growing up 
        was oxtail soup.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was primarily a colder weather dish, for late autumn through winter. I remember 
        my halmoni would make a large pot of this, and I'd come get some and drop in a scoop 
        of rice. Mmm... it was best a day or 2 later though, as that allowed the flavors to 
        meld together more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ok yeah, that part about my halmoni was made up. Growing up, my only living halmoni 
        was in Korea while I was in the suburbs of Chicago. But the rest of it is true!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oxtails</li>
        <li>Radishes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Green Onions (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak your oxtails. These will likely have little hairs, blood, etc. on them. 
            You want to get them in a large bowl and let it sit for at least 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Get your oxtails in a pot of water. You'll bring it to a boil, but then you'll 
            want to remove your oxtails (you can use the bowl you used for soaking if you've
            rinsed it out) so that you can dump the water. This will likely have a lot of the 
            gunk that'll have come off the meat.
        </li>
        <li>Put your oxtails in a pot of fresh water (again). This time, you can keep the water 
            although you'll still need to skim it sometimes.
        </li>
        <li>Let it boil for a while.</li>
        <li>Once it softens up enough (after a few hours likely) cut up your radishes and drop
            those pieces into the pot also.
        </li>
        <li>Once everything is soft, remove from heat. Oh, add salt and pepper. You can also
            garnish with the green onion, but I often forget to buy this ingredient.
        </li>
    </ol>
